## Peer Feedback for Group 5

1. Introductions

The motivation of this report is clearly stated and easy to understand. The introduction of face-to-face crime rate comes with an interesting perspective through formula derivation from \texttt{mix} variable.

2. The Initial EDA

The transformations of variables could be part of the initial or subsequent portion of the EDA analysis. Any particular reason to call the combined wage variable as \texttt{wave} instead of \texttt{wage}? Did a sample mean without considering their weight composition may reduce influence of certain variables.

There are anomalous values identified but no further action is performed to have them adjusted or removed for EDA. There is no further analysis of each variable to see if further transformation is needed to expose linear relationships in scatterplots.

The scatterplots are a bit too small and busy to see the correlation. It is true that covariates may have casual effects, but they are more inspected for correlation rather than casual effect.

3. The Model Building Process

There is no explanation behind how the 3 models being come up with and related to the EDA. There are side-by-side comparisons on both outcome variables \texttt{crmrte} and \texttt{fcrmrte} with same 3 models for each. There is not enough explanation to understand the meaning through visualization.

4. The Regression Table

More explanations are needed on how the model specifications are properly chosen to outline the boundary of reasonable choices. However, it is easy to find key coefficients in the regression table, but there is no further discussion of practical significance for key effects.

5. The Omitted Variables Discussion

No discussion on omitted variables.

6. Conclusion

The conclusion addresses the big-picture concerns about the political campaign in a qualitative manner. Interesting points are identified on police per capita against crime rate.

7. Throughout the Report

No significant errors, faulty logic, or unpersuasive writing that leads to less convincing conclusions. 

Following attaches report of Group 5 Lab 3 Part 1.
